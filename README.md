# 🚀 GalaxiX
## 🎮 So... What’s your mission?
**GalaxiX** is a pixelated cosmic game where you, a lone space punk, are stuck in a forgotten corner of the universe. 

- 🛸 Jump across random corners of the galaxy
- 💥 Blast weird creatures.
~~(Or become one of them. **Your call.**)~~

## 🛸 Highlights

- **Wander through** creepy planets, junkyard space stations, and angry asteroid fields.
- **Smack aliens** with whatever laser blaster you can find.
- **Dynamic soundtrack** – it grooves when you groove, it panics when you panic.
- **Collect power-ups** – because caffeine doesn’t exist in space, but upgrades do.
  
## ⚙️ Built With

- 🧠 **Java + LibGDX** — brains behind the space
- 🗺️ **Tiled** — building chaotic cosmic levels
- 🎛️ **Skin Composer** — for that stylish space GUI
- 🗄️ **JSON** — because someone has to remember your fail

**Requirements:**
- ☕ Java 17+

If your spaceship explodes on launch... open an issue. I'll cry with you.
